// Streim.Pipe() :

// def : Stream.pipe() method used to take readable stream and connect it to a writable stream 


// 1.Piping in Node.js is a mechanism for connecting a readable stream to a writable stream, 
//allowing data to flow from one stream to another automatically and efficiently.
// 2.When you pipe streams, data is read from the source (readable stream) and directly written to the destination (writable stream) without needing to manually manage reading and writing.
// 3.When you use the .pipe() method, it reads chunks of data from the readable stream and writes them to the writable stream. This is particularly useful for working with large data, as it doesnâ€™t require the entire data to be loaded into memory at once.

// Benifits of Pipe()

// Memory efficiency: Since data is processed in chunks, there's no need to load the entire data into memory at once.
// Simplified code: Piping eliminates the need to manually handle reading and writing logic.
// Chaining: Multiple streams (e.g., readable, transform, writable) can be chained together.

const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Create a readable stream for 'data.txt'
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('data.txt', 'utf-8');

    // Pipe the readable stream directly to the response stream (res)
    readStream.pipe(res);

    // Handle errors on the readStream
    readStream.on('error', (error) => {
        console.error('Read error:', error);
        res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Error reading file');
    });
});

server.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 8000...');
});
