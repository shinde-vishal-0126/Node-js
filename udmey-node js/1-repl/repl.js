//| repl js

// repl is best payGround because we have to used for run some command or try out certain things because we execute we write 

// R -> read user input
// E -> evaluate user input
// P -> print output (or result)
// L -> loop to return and wait for new user input.

// repl basically used to experiments, test, execute and debug the node js code .


// javascript :

// 1 weakly typed language : no explicit type assignment (i.e it dynamically type language )
// 2 object-oriented language : data can be organized in logical objects
// 3 versatile language : versatile means we have to run on different platform like browser, and also on server
