// Buffer is a temporary storage area that holds binary data.
// It allows you to work with raw binary data directly
// Buffers are typically used when dealing with streams of data (such as file I/O, network streams, or cryptographic operations
// Buffers are immutable in size, i.e., once created, their size cannot be changed.
